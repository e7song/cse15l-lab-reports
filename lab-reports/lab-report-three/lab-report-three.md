#### *Different ways to use grep*   
If you need to search for a specific word in a certain file, it's pretty   
straightforward to use `grep <word> <file>`. However, in the case where you   
don't know exactly what you are searching for and where you need to search for   
there are helpful modifications you can add on to the grep command.   

##### **Method  #1- Recursive Searching**   
`grep -r <word> <path (optional)>`
The modifier here will recursively search through the path given, looking at   
all the files within as well as the subdirectories until all the files are   
searched. This command is especially helpful when you don't know where the word   
you are searching for is, just that it exists.
