# CSE 15L Winter 2023 Lab Report #4   
### Eric Song, Wed. 1 p.m.   
## **__Week 7- CSE Labs "Done Quick"__**   

### **__Introduction__**   
Lab 7 was my favorite lab because it was fun experimenting with how I could make process of running each step smoother and faster. 
This would include using techniques such as the pressing up/down arrow to navigate previously used commands and various other shortcuts.   

### __**Previous Process**__      
```
+-- lab7
|   +-- lib
|       +-- hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
|       +-- junit-4.13.2.jar
|   +-- ListExamples.java
|   +-- ListExamplesTests.java
```   
To clone the repository, I would use `git clone git@github.com:e7song/lab7.git <enter>`.   
For compiling the code, I would use `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java <enter>`.   
For running the code, I would use `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests <enter>`.   
To fix the error, I would use `nano ListExamples.java <enter>`.   
Finally, to push and commit to github, I would use `git commit -am "Resolved infinite loop error" && git push <enter>`.   
Although I managed to cut my time down to about one minute, this challenge could have been completed much faster with a script.
