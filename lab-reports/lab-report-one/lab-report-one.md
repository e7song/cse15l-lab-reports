Opening up VS Code should bring you to a window that looks like this:

##### Personal Process for Part One
I already had VS Code installed from CSE 11, so I skipped this step entirely.

## Part Two- Remote Access

Download and install git.
[git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
[git for MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

##### Personal Process for Installing Git
I did not have git installed yet, so I followed the steps outlined above to download it and set it as my default profile in my VS Code terminal.

The next step is to remotely connect. In the VS Code terminal, type ```ssh cs15lwi23___@ieng6.ucsd.edu```.
The blank should be unique to each person.

In the VS Code window, press ``` CTRL + ` ``` to open up the terminal.
