# **CSE 15L Lab Report 1- Remote Access Tutorial**

## Part One- Visual Studio Code Installation (skip if it has already been installed)

Download VS Code via [this link] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Follow the installation steps from the website. (*Mac users may see a slightly different site than the picture below.*)

Opening up VS Code should bring you to a window that looks like this:

##### Personal Process for Part One
I already had VS Code installed from CSE 11, so I skipped this step entirely.

## Part Two- Remote Access

Download and install git.
[git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
[git for MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

> To set git bash as your default terminal, follow this list of steps.
> 1. press ```CTRL + SHIFT + P``` to show all commands
> 2. type *Select Default Profile* and select "Git Bash"<br /> <img src="labreportone_ra_1.png" alt="" title="Command Line" width="633" height="83" />

> 4. to change terminal types <br /> <img src="labreportone_ra_2.png" alt="." title="." width="161" height="192" />`

##### Personal Process for Installing Git
I did not have git installed yet, so I followed the steps outlined above to download it and set it as my default profile in my VS Code terminal.

The next step is to remotely connect. In the VS Code terminal, type ```ssh cs15lwi23___@ieng6.ucsd.edu```.
The blank should be unique to each person.

> **To find your unique identifier**
> 1. [Click on this link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
> 2. log in with your username and student ID
> 3. scroll down until you find this section <br /> <img src="labreportone_ra_4.png" alt="" title="STudent Account" width="310" height="82" />
> 4. note: you have need to change your passsword to set one for the remote access process

This is what pops up for me. I had to additionally type in "yes" since I was connecting for the first time. I also had issues revolving around the password; changing the password changed the password for all my UCSD accounts rather than just that course specific account.

<br /> *Side note: although the password section looks blank, the terminal is reading your keyboard inputs*

## Part Three- Trying Some Commands
