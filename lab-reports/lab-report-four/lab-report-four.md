### Step 2: Setup   
Click on this [link](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7) to go to the required repository and then fork it.   
```
+-- lab7
|   +-- lib
|       +-- hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
|       +-- junit-4.13.2.jar
|   +-- ListExamples.java
|   +-- ListExamplesTests.java
```   
Once this repository is forked, you should have the above files.   

### Step 3: Start  
Use a time keeping device to keep track of how long it takes for you to do steps 4-9.   

### Step 4: Log into ieng6   
Type `ssh cs15lwi23amv@ieng6.ucsd.edu` (exact login will vary based on user).
